                <h1>Intro</h1>
                <p style="color:#CF0">Mao is the greatest card game in existence.</p>
                <p style="color:#F0A">To play Mao, you need a group of awesome people and one deck of cards per 3-4 people in the group (a minimum of two decks).</p>
                <p style="color:#CF0">The goal of Mao is to get rid of all of your cards.</p>
                <p style="color:#F0A">To play a card, it must match the suit or rank of the active card (the last card played).</p>
                <p style="color:#CF0">Jokers (if you choose to use them) may only be played on top of face cards and have no effect on the active suit.  You may not two-it a Joker.</p>
                <h1>Starting</h1>
                <p>To begin a game of Mao, one player is chosen as the dealer.  The dealer then deals each player seven cards.  Other players may not touch any cards before the game begins; doing so results in a penalty.  The dealer then names a player and a direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise), turns over the top card of the deck, and the game begins.</p>
                <h1>Penalties</h1>
                <p>The heart of Mao lies in its dynamic <span class="navlink" onclick="toggleSection('#rules');">Rules</span> and avoiding the penalties for breaking them.  Any time a player breaks one of the rules, it is up to the other players to catch it.  They must then say "penalty for", followed by an explanation of the action that broke the rule (but not necessarily the rule itself).  The player must then take one card as their penalty.
                <h1>Point of Order</h1>
                <p>A player may call "point of order" at any point during the game.  All players must immediately put their hand down; you may not touch any cards besides the draw stack and discard pile.  During a Point of Order, all verbal rules are suspended (unless specified otherwise).  A Point of Order may only be ended by the person that started it saying "end point of order".</p>
                <h1>Winning the Game</h1>
                <p>To win a game of Mao, a player must play their last card without breaking any rules and say "Mao", unless the last card is a Jack, in which case they must say "Mao Mao".  If they fail to do this, or break any other rules during the play, they must draw one card, take back their winning card, and forfeit their turn.</p>

                <p>In the advanced form of Mao, any time a player wins a round they get to add a new rule to the game.  The rule can be anything, as long as it is completely unbiased.  They do not have to tell the other players what the rule is, but in some cases it would be wise to.  Here is a collection of some favorite rules to implement.</p>
